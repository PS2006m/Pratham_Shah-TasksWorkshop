My Reason for using Django is that Django Framework allows me to use Frontend languages like 
HTML,CSS and JS ,
which allows for a more customized styling while also providing a backend while Streamlit or Gradio 
does not allow that , and in case of ReactPy , I cannot create multiple webpages whereas Django
does allow that given you follow a proper flow of urls .
